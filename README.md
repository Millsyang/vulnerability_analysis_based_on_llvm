# Vulnerability Analysis Based on LLVM

### Build LLVM 
```sh 
	$ cd llvm 
	$ ./build-llvm.sh 
	# The installed LLVM is of version 10.0.0 
```

### Build the analyzer 
```sh 
	# Build the analysis pass of Crix 
	$ cd ../analyzer 
	$ make 
	# Now, you can find the executable, `kanalyzer`, in `build/lib/`
```

### Prepare LLVM bitcode files of OS kernels

* Replace error-code definition files of the Linux kernel with the ones in "encoded-errno"
* The code should be compiled with the built LLVM
* Compile the code with options: -O0 or -O2, -g, -fno-inline
* Generate bitcode files
	- We have our own tool to generate bitcode files: https://github.com/sslab-gatech/deadline/tree/release/work. Note that files (typically less than 10) with compilation errors are simply discarded
	- We also provided the pre-compiled bitcode files - https://github.com/umnsec/linux-bitcode

### Run the analyzer
```sh
	# To analyze a single bitcode file, say "test.bc", run:
	$ ./build/lib/kanalyzer -sc test.bc
	# To analyze a list of bitcode files, put the absolute paths of the bitcode files in a file, say "bc.list", then run:
	$ ./build/lib/kanalyzer -mc @bc.list
```
